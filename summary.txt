‘Aaliya.’ Aaliya could still hear her mother’s voice clearly inside her head,
as the black pencil hovered over the white paper.
And in her mind, she could see her mother’s pink shalwar kameez,
her older sister Sara’s orange T-shirt, her father’s green shirt.
Do you want to come?’  No, Aaliya didn’t want to go,
They went to the market every Sunday morning to buy tuna-fish
and vegetables - it was nothing special.
‘We'll have breakfast when we get back,’ her mother told her.
‘Be good!’  The classroom was cool, the fan purring softly overhead.
